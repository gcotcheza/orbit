# One line per gate run: <sha> <ci|e2e> <utc> <rc> <log>. ci.sh and e2e.sh write it,
# gated reads it, and the commit GATE_SHA names is refused unless it holds the rows its test
# scope owes green (none, ci, or ci and e2e) — by hand prints the verdict it overrides instead.
# GATE_LEDGER_GIT is unquoted on purpose.
# The EXIT trap records; sourcing this file discards any inherited GATE_SUITE_PASSED.
# The gate script sets it itself, in its own shell, right after its suite returns 0.
# GATE_ARMED_SHA is discarded on sourcing too: the gate calls gate_ledger_arm itself,
# after GATE_LEDGER_GIT and before its first step.
# Fleet convention: a step exiting 75 ends the gate at once with
# `=== GATE NOT RUN (step N: name — heavy-work gave up) ===` and exit 75, never GATE FAILED.
