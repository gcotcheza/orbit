| Everything about THIS app rather than about the framework it runs on. It
| starts small — the one account — and is where the fare providers, the deal
| score's weights and the alert thresholds land as they arrive.
|
| WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, rather than env() being read where it is
| needed: `php artisan config:cache` compiles every config file into one array
| and then env() returns NULL for everything, because the .env is no longer
| loaded. A seeder that reads env() directly therefore works perfectly in
| development and silently creates the DEFAULT user on a cached production
| deploy. Config files are the one place env() is safe, which is exactly what
| Larastan's `noEnvCallsOutsideOfConfig` rule is pointing at.
